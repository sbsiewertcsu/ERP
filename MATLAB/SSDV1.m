%% Object Detection Using SSD Deep Learning
% This example shows how to train a Single Shot Detector (SSD).
%% Overview
% Deep learning is a powerful machine learning technique that automatically 
% learns image features required for detection tasks. There are several techniques 
% for object detection using deep learning such as Faster R-CNN, You Only Look 
% Once (YOLO v2), and SSD. This example trains an SSD vehicle detector using the 
% |trainSSDObjectDetector| function. For more information, see <docid:vision_doccenter#bvd8yot-1 
% Object Detection using Deep Learning>.
%% Download Pretrained Detector
% Download a pretrained detector to avoid having to wait for training to complete. 
% If you want to train the detector, set the |doTraining| variable to true.

% Make sure GPU is used if machine has one - auto is best, cpu is cpu only, and gpu is gpu only
executionEnvironment = "auto";

doTraining = true;
if ~doTraining && ~exist('ssdResNet50VehicleExample_20a.mat','file')
    disp('Downloading pretrained detector (44 MB)...');
    pretrainedURL = 'https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/vision/data/ssdResNet50VehicleExample_20a.mat';
    websave('ssdResNet50VehicleExample_20a.mat',pretrainedURL);
end
%% Load Dataset
% This example uses a small vehicle data set that contains 295 images. Each 
% image contains one or two labeled instances of a vehicle. A small data set is 
% useful for exploring the SSD training procedure, but in practice, more labeled 
% images are needed to train a robust detector.

unzip vehicleDatasetImages.zip
data = load('vehicleDatasetGroundTruth.mat');
vehicleDataset = data.vehicleDataset;
%% 
% The training data is stored in a table. The first column contains the path 
% to the image files. The remaining columns contain the ROI labels for vehicles. 
% Display the first few rows of the data.

vehicleDataset(1:4,:)
%% 
% Split the data set into a training set for training the detector and a test 
% set for evaluating the detector. Select 60% of the data for training. Use the 
% rest for evaluation.

rng(0);
shuffledIndices = randperm(height(vehicleDataset));
idx = floor(0.6 * length(shuffledIndices) );
trainingData = vehicleDataset(shuffledIndices(1:idx),:);
testData = vehicleDataset(shuffledIndices(idx+1:end),:);
%% 
% Use |imageDatastore| and |boxLabelDatastore| to load the image and label data 
% during training and evaluation.

imdsTrain = imageDatastore(trainingData{:,'imageFilename'});
bldsTrain = boxLabelDatastore(trainingData(:,'vehicle'));

imdsTest = imageDatastore(testData{:,'imageFilename'});
bldsTest = boxLabelDatastore(testData(:,'vehicle'));
%% 
% Combine image and box label datastores.

trainingData = combine(imdsTrain,bldsTrain);
testData = combine(imdsTest, bldsTest);
%% 
% Display one of the training images and box labels.

data = read(trainingData);
I = data{1};
bbox = data{2};
annotatedImage = insertShape(I,'Rectangle',bbox);
annotatedImage = imresize(annotatedImage,2);

%% Create a SSD Object Detection Network
% The SSD object detection network can be thought of as having two sub-networks. 
% A feature extraction network, followed by a detection network. 
% 
% The feature extraction network is typically a pretrained CNN (see <docid:nnet_ug#bvf9ych-1 
% pretrained CNN> for more details). This example uses ResNet-50 for feature extraction. 
% Other pretrained networks such as MobileNet v2 or ResNet-18 can also be used 
% depending on application requirements. The detection sub-network is a small 
% CNN compared to the feature extraction network and is composed of a few convolutional 
% layers and layers specific to SSD.
% 
% Use the |ssdLayers| function to automatically modify a pretrained ResNet-50 
% network into a SSD object detection network. |ssdLayers| requires you to specify 
% several inputs that parameterize the SSD network, including the network input 
% size and the number of classes. When choosing the network input size, consider 
% the size of the training images, and the computational cost incurred by processing 
% data at the selected size. When feasible, choose a network input size that is 
% close to the size of the training image. However, to reduce the computational 
% cost of running this example, the network input size is chosen to be [300 300 
% 3]. During training, |trainSSDObjectDetector| automatically resizes the training 
% images to the network input size.

inputSize = [300 300 3];
%% 
% Define number of object classes to detect.

numClasses = width(vehicleDataset)-1;
%% 
% Create the SSD object detection network. 

lgraph = ssdLayers(inputSize, numClasses, 'resnet50');
%% 
% You can visualize the network using |analyzeNetwork| or D|eepNetworkDesigner| 
% from Deep Learning Toolbox™. Note that you can also create a custom SSD network 
% layer-by-layer. For more information, see <docid:vision_examples#mw_8dbc8041-7863-4460-a915-bb2de6b55607 
% Create SSD Object Detection Network>. 
%% Data Augmentation
% Data augmentation is used to improve network accuracy by randomly transforming 
% the original data during training. By using data augmentation, you can add more 
% variety to the training data without actually having to increase the number 
% of labeled training samples. Use |transform| to augment the training data by 
%% 
% * Randomly flipping the image and associated box labels horizontally. 
% * Randomly scale the image, associated box labels.
% * Jitter image color.
%% 
% Note that data augmentation is not applied to the test data. Ideally, test 
% data should be representative of the original data and is left unmodified for 
% unbiased evaluation.

augmentedTrainingData = transform(trainingData,@augmentData);
%% 
% Visualize augmented training data by reading the same image multiple times.

augmentedData = cell(4,1);
for k = 1:4
    data = read(augmentedTrainingData);
    augmentedData{k} = insertShape(data{1},'Rectangle',data{2});
    reset(augmentedTrainingData);
end

figure
montage(augmentedData,'BorderSize',10)
%% Preprocess Training Data
% Preprocess the augmented training data to prepare for training.

preprocessedTrainingData = transform(augmentedTrainingData,@(data)preprocessData(data,inputSize));
%% 
% Read the preprocessed training data.

data = read(preprocessedTrainingData);
%% 
% Display the image and bounding boxes.

I = data{1};
bbox = data{2};
annotatedImage = insertShape(I,'Rectangle',bbox);
annotatedImage = imresize(annotatedImage,2);
figure
imshow(annotatedImage)
%% Train SSD Object Detector
% Use |trainingOptions| to specify network training options. Set |'CheckpointPath'| 
% to a temporary location. This enables the saving of partially trained detectors 
% during the training process. If training is interrupted, such as by a power 
% outage or system failure, you can resume training from the saved checkpoint.

options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
        'MiniBatchSize', 16, ....
        'InitialLearnRate',1e-1, ...
        'LearnRateSchedule', 'piecewise', ...
        'LearnRateDropPeriod', 30, ...
        'LearnRateDropFactor', 0.8, ...
        'MaxEpochs', 300, ...
        'VerboseFrequency', 1, ...        
        'CheckpointPath', tempdir, ...
        'Shuffle','every-epoch');
%% 
% Use <docid:vision_ref#mw_0ff9d26a-9a79-4333-a1b1-ba03c8539ee3 |trainSSDObjectDetector|> 
% function to train SSD object detector if |doTraining| to true. Otherwise, load 
% a pretrained network.

if doTraining
    % Train the SSD detector.
    [detector, info] = trainSSDObjectDetector(preprocessedTrainingData,lgraph,options);
else
    % Load pretrained detector for the example.
    pretrained = load('ssdResNet50VehicleExample_20a.mat');
    detector = pretrained.detector;
end
%% 
% This example is verified on an NVIDIA™ Titan X GPU with 12 GB of memory. If 
% your GPU has less memory, you may run out of memory. If this happens, lower 
% the '|MiniBatchSize|' using the |trainingOptions| function. Training this network 
% took approximately 2 hours using this setup. Training time varies depending 
% on the hardware you use.
% 
% As a quick test, run the detector on one test image.

data = read(testData);
I = data{1,1};
I = imresize(I,inputSize(1:2));
[bboxes,scores] = detect(detector,I, 'Threshold', 0.4);
%% 
% Display the results.

I = insertObjectAnnotation(I,'rectangle',bboxes,scores);

%% Evaluate Detector Using Test Set
% Evaluate the trained object detector on a large set of images to measure the 
% performance. Computer Vision Toolbox™ provides object detector evaluation functions 
% to measure common metrics such as average precision (|evaluateDetectionPrecision|) 
% and log-average miss rates (|evaluateDetectionMissRate|). For this example, 
% use the average precision metric to evaluate performance. The average precision 
% provides a single number that incorporates the ability of the detector to make 
% correct classifications (|precision|) and the ability of the detector to find 
% all relevant objects (|recall|).
% 
% Apply the same preprocessing transform to the test data as for the training 
% data. Note that data augmentation is not applied to the test data. Test data 
% should be representative of the original data and be left unmodified for unbiased 
% evaluation.

preprocessedTestData = transform(testData,@(data)preprocessData(data,inputSize));
%% 
% Run the detector on all the test images.

detectionResults = detect(detector, preprocessedTestData, 'Threshold', 0.4);
%% 
% Evaluate the object detector using average precision metric.

[ap,recall,precision] = evaluateDetectionPrecision(detectionResults, preprocessedTestData);
%% 
% The precision/recall (PR) curve highlights how precise a detector is at varying 
% levels of recall. Ideally, the precision would be 1 at all recall levels. The 
% use of more data can help improve the average precision, but might require more 
% training time Plot the PR curve.

%% Code Generation
% Once the detector is trained and evaluated, you can generate code for the 
% |ssdObjectDetector| using GPU Coder™. For more details, see <docid:vision_examples#mw_3571a5d0-b4b8-4965-9a9b-41ac8d8b5360
